A KVM Virtual Machine Manager in JavaScript

## introduction

this is an attempt to build a functioning and useful virtual machine manager (vmm)
completely in JavaScript, on the "lo" JavaScript [runtime]().

## todo

- handle terminal io correctly
- figure out why it hangs when we enable the IRQ chip
- add pvh boot support for loading vmlinux 
- run the cpu on it's own thread
